This is my attempts at solving this problem: that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

My first attempt I got a 66% on the Codility Test and I am hoping to end up in the 90%-100% range ideally. Right now my score has a 100% correctness but a 25% for efficiency so I need to learn about effiecient algorithms, big O notation and figure out how to create more efficient algorithms.

On my second attempt I made my first attempt at using hashing to find the solution. This resulted in me getting an 88% which is a great improvement.

To get the grade up to a 100% I simply had to make a small change that I believed helped account for an edge case of one of the tests.
